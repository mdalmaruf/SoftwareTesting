# ICE1: Review of Python

## **Introduction**
This activity is designed to review fundamental Python concepts and guide you in completing the assignment for analyzing movie budgets.

## **Part 1: Review of Python Concepts**

### **1. Python Data Types**
Python offers several data types for handling data:
- **int**: For integers (e.g., `10`, `-3`).
- **float**: For decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-1.5`).
- **str**: For text (e.g., `"Hello World"`).
- **bool**: For Boolean values (`True`, `False`).
- **list**: Mutable collection (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
- **tuple**: Immutable collection (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
- **dict**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`).
  #### **Examples**:
```python
# Integers and Floats
x = 10
y = 3.14

# Strings
greeting = "Hello, Python!"

# Boolean
is_active = True

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

---

### **1.2 Mutable vs Immutable Types**
- **Mutable**: Can be changed (e.g., `list`, `dict`).
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed (e.g., `tuple`, `str`).

#### **Examples**:
```python
# Mutable List
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("cherry")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Immutable Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
# coordinates[0] = 15  # Error: Tuples are immutable
```

---

### **1.3 Python Collections: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries**
#### **List Example**
```python
# Lists are mutable and can store mixed data types
movies = ["Interstellar", "Inception", "Titanic"]
movies.append("Avatar")
print(movies)  # ['Interstellar', 'Inception', 'Titanic', 'Avatar']
```
#### **Tuple Example**
```python
# Tuples are immutable
movie_details = ("Interstellar", "Christopher Nolan", 2014, 165000000)
print(movie_details)  # ('Interstellar', 'Christopher Nolan', 2014, 165000000)

```

#### **Dictionary Example**
```python
# Dictionaries store key-value pairs
movie = {"title": "Interstellar", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "year": 2014}
print(movie["title"])  # Interstellar
```
---
## **2. Loops**
Loops allow repetition of code.

#### **For Loop**:
```python
# Iterating over a list
movies = ["Inception", "Titanic", "Avatar"]
for movie in movies:
    print(movie)
```

#### **While Loop**:
```python
# Repeating until a condition is met
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```
---


## **3. Conditionals**
Conditionals allow decision-making.

#### **Example**:
```python
# If-else Example
budget = 200000000
if budget > 150000000:
    print("High budget movie")
else:
    print("Low budget movie")
```

---
## **4. Important Libraries**
- `math`: For mathematical operations.
- `random`: For generating random numbers.
- `statistics`: For statistical calculations.
- `os`: For file and directory operations

# Comprehensive Python Tutorial: Basics, Data Types, and Movie Budget Analysis

## **Introduction**
This tutorial covers fundamental Python concepts and provides a step-by-step guide to completing an assignment that analyzes movie budgets. You will learn about Python's data types, loops, conditionals, and file handling.

---

## **1. Review of Python Basics**

### **1.1 Python Data Types**
Python supports the following types of data:

- **int**: Integer values (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
- **float**: Decimal values (e.g., `3.14`, `-1.0`).
- **str**: Text values (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).
- **bool**: Boolean values (`True`, `False`).
- **list**: Ordered, mutable collections (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
- **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collections (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
- **dict**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`).





### **1.5 File Handling**
Python allows reading from and writing to files.

#### **Example**:
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Hello, World!
```

---

## **2. Assignment: Movie Budget Analysis**

### **Objective**
1. Calculate the **average budget** of movies.
2. Identify movies with budgets **higher than the average**.
3. Print the **number of movies** above the average budget.
4. Allow users to **add movies** to the dataset.
5. Use `MovieList.txt` for input and save results in `Output.txt`.

---

### **Step 1: Prepare the Files**
- **MovieList.txt** (Input File):
```
Movie Name, Budget
Interstellar, 165000000
Inception, 160000000
Titanic, 200000000
Avengers: Endgame, 356000000
Frozen II, 150000000
```

- **Output.txt** (Output File): Will be generated by the program.

---

### **Step 2: Python Code**

#### **Starter Code**:
```python
# Author: Your Name
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD
# Description: Analyze movie budgets and save results to a file.

def calculate_average_budget(movies):
    """Calculate the average budget of all movies."""
    budgets = [budget for _, budget in movies]
    return sum(budgets) / len(budgets)

def find_high_budget_movies(movies, average_budget):
    """Find movies with budgets higher than the average."""
    return [(name, budget) for name, budget in movies if budget > average_budget]

def read_movies_from_file(file_name):
    """Read movies from a file."""
    movies = []
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()[1:]  # Skip header
        for line in lines:
            name, budget = line.strip().split(", ")
            movies.append((name, int(budget)))
    return movies

def write_results_to_file(file_name, average_budget, high_budget_movies):
    """Write analysis results to a file."""
    with open(file_name, "w") as file:
        file.write(f"Average Budget: ${average_budget:,.2f}\n")
        file.write("Movies with Budgets Higher than Average:\n")
        for name, budget in high_budget_movies:
            file.write(f"{name}: ${budget:,}\n")

def main():
    # Read movies from file
    movies = read_movies_from_file("MovieList.txt")

    # Calculate average budget
    average_budget = calculate_average_budget(movies)

    # Find high-budget movies
    high_budget_movies = find_high_budget_movies(movies, average_budget)

    # Print results
    print(f"Average Budget: ${average_budget:,.2f}")
    print("Movies with Budgets Higher than Average:")
    for name, budget in high_budget_movies:
        print(f"  {name}: ${budget:,}")

    # Write results to output file
    write_results_to_file("Output.txt", average_budget, high_budget_movies)
    print("Results saved to 'Output.txt'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### **Step 3: Execution and Submission**
1. **Run the Program**:
   - Ensure `MovieList.txt` exists in the same directory as the Python file.
   - Execute the program and verify the output in the console and `Output.txt`.

2. **Submission Requirements**:
   - Provide screenshots of:
     - Console output (program execution).
     - Contents of `Output.txt`.
   - Submit your `.py` file and `MovieList.txt`.

## **3. Summary**
This tutorial covered Python basics and guided you through creating a movie budget analysis program. By practicing these concepts, you'll develop a strong foundation in Python programming.
